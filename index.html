            We are Barbara and Jetter Strickland and we have been breeding Boxers for over 10 years in beautiful Springfield,
            South Carolina. Each puppy receives veternarian care the first day of life
            and first shots before joining your family. We socialize the puppies with our family,
            so they will be ready for yours. <br/>
            If you are unable to pick up your puppy, we can arrange transportion.

          <h2>About the Boxer breed:</h2>

           <p>
             <!-- A well bred Boxer in peak condition is an beautiful sight. A male can
           stand as high as 25 inches at the shoulder; females run smaller. Their
           muscles ripple beneath a short, tight-fitting coat. The dark brown
           eyes and wrinkled forehead give the face an alert, curious look.  -->
           The coat can be fawn or brindle, with white markings.
           <!-- Boxers move like the athletes they are named for: smooth and graceful, with a powerful forward thrust. -->
           Boxers are upbeat and playful. Their patience and protective nature have earned
           them a reputation as a great dog with children. They take the jobs of watchdog and
           family guardian seriously and will meet threats fearlessly. Boxers do best
           when exposed to a lot of people and other animals in early puppyhood.</p>
